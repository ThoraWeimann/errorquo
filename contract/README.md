# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Add your contracts in the "contracts" folder and change the scripts and test accordingly.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

To compile, test and run your contracts:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
